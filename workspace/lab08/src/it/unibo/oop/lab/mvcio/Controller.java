public class Controller {

    /*
     * This class must implement a simple controller responsible of I/O access. It
     * considers a single file at a time, and it is able to serialize objects in it.
     * 
     * Implement this class in such a way that:
     * 
     * 1) It has a method for setting a File as current file
     * 
     * 2) It has a method for getting the current File
     * 
     * 3) It has a method for getting the path (in form of String) of the current
     * File
     * 
     * 4) It has a method that gets a Serializable as input and saves such Object in
     * the current file. Remember how to use the ObjectOutputStream. This method may
     * throw IOException.
     * 
     * 5) By default, the current file is "output.dat" inside the user home folder.
     * A String representing the local user home folder can be accessed using
     * System.getProperty("user.home"). The separator symbol (/ on *nix, \ on
     * Windows) can be obtained as String through the method
     * System.getProperty("file.separator"). The combined use of those methods leads
     * to a software that run correctly on every platform.
