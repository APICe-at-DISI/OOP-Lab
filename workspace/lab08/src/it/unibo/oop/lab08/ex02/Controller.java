	 * TODO - Implement this class in such a way that:
	 * 
	 * 1) It has a method for setting a File as current file
	 * 
	 * 2) It has a method for getting the current File
	 * 
	 * 3) It has a method for getting the path (in form of String) of the
	 * current File
	 * 
	 * 4) It has a method that gets a String as input and saves such string in
	 * the current file
	 * 
	 * 5) By default, the current file is "output.txt" inside the user home
	 * folder. A String representing the local user home folder can be accessed
	 * using System.getProperty("user.home"). The separator symbol (/ on *nix, \
	 * on Windows) can be obtained as String through the method
	 * System.getProperty("file.separator"). The combined use of those methods
	 * leads to a software that run correctly on every platform.
